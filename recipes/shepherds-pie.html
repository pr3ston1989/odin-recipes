    <li>
      Place olive oil and butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat.<br>

      the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring mixture<br>
      to a simmer; cook and stir until thick, 5 to 6 minutes. 
    </li>

      Remove lamb mixture from heat, then stir in peas and<br>
      carrots until combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread lamb mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish;<br>
      set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place potatoes into a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil,<br>
      reduce heat to medium, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes.<br>
      Drain well and return potatoes to the pot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mash Irish cheese, cream cheese, butter, and cayenne pepper into<br>
      potatoes until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Whisk together egg yolk and milk in a small bowl; stir into<br>
      mashed potato mixture. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Top lamb mixture in the baking dish with mashed potatoes;<br>
      spread evenly to cover. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and<br>
      sauce is bubbling up around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.

  </ol>
